## Development Environment

This project uses a Docker container as a development environment, which includes tools like Azure CLI, PowerShell, Azure Bicep, Azure Developer CLI (azd), Terraform, TFLint, and Terragrunt.

- **Azure CLI**: Used for managing Azure resources.
- **PowerShell**: A cross-platform task automation solution.
- **Azure Bicep**: A declarative language for deploying Azure resources.
- **Azure Developer CLI (azd)**: Streamlines the process of building, deploying, and managing Azure applications.
- **Terraform**: An open-source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.
- **TFLint**: A Terraform linter for detecting errors that cannot be detected by `terraform plan`.
- **Terragrunt**: A thin wrapper for Terraform that provides extra tools for working with multiple Terraform modules.

## Code Quality and Linting

This project uses [MegaLinter](https://megalinter.io/latest/) to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices. [MegaLinter](https://megalinter.io/latest/) analyzes the codebase for potential issues, coding standards violations, formatting discrepancies, and more across multiple languages and file formats. It helps maintain a high standard of code quality and consistency across the project.
